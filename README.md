This app is aiming to reduce plastic and styrofoam  box usage by small and medium level food chains 
This is a collaboration app (mobile based) to address bigger problem related to climate change. We are trying to reduce usage of plastic bags,cups styrofoam box
by small and medium food chain liek restaurants, juice bar, coffe shops, bubble tea stores. 
This all will reward you if you bring your bag or bring your own tumbler, and container for take out. 
Right now we have android app where vendors can subscribe and enlist them, user can register, have their profile. 
Now every time they go to store, scan a QR code from the vendor and show that they brough reusable stuff, they get points. 
 When they accumulate enought points say 10000, they can redeem it in any store, or donate it. 
 User can also have local or global group and competer for points.
